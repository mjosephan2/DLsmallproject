50.039 Theory & Practice of Deep Learning - Small Project

## Introduction
This is a project where we have to classify lung xray images - normal, infected(non-covid), infected(covid)  

## Exploration
For a good visual overview of what was developed, training, model, etc., 
you could take a look at these notebooks:

## Usage
The saved models have been saved under 'models'.   
To use the models for prediction and inference, you could use the functions
in this file. For greater detail of how the functions could be used, you could take a look at this jupyter notebook () 
where the saved models are used.
